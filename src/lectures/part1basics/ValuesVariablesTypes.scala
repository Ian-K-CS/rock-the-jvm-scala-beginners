 // Questions
 // diff between float and double? - the size of it. Float uses 7 bits and a double uses more. normal to use doubles.
 // why do we explicitly define values and not infer? - to make things clearer and more human readable.
 // are values just constant variables? - Yes - hardly ever use 'var' in our codebase, we don't normally infer values

 // SIDE EFFECTS - Side-effect is any external effect a function has besides its return value.
 // A function as we know has its own scope, itâ€™s safe if we mutate variables within its scope.
 // We call them side-effects when it uses or changes stuff outside its scope like a variable passed by reference, global variable,
 // reading user input from the console, logging to console, doing database operations, etc.
 // calling a method calling another method is fine.
