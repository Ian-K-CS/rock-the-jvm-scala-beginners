    Q&A
    1. Implement Novel and a Writer Classes

      - method: authorAge @ year of novel release
      - isWrittenBy (author)
      - copy (method receives new year of release(a revision of the book)) - returns new instance of Novel.

// OOP quick refresher notes

// Constructor - used to initialize an objects state.
// Scala has 2 types of constructor - Primary & Auxiliary
// Primary Constructor - when the Scala program contains only one constructor. Can only have 1 primary constructor.
// Auxiliary Constructor - other constructors other than primary constructor. Can has many auxiliary constructors.

// Initialisation - assignment of initial value(s) for instance variables / fields.
